  "title": "Agent Idea Canvas",
  "estimatedTime": "20 minutes",
  "overview": "Define the AI agent you'll build as your capstone project. This exercise helps you think through what problem you want to solve and what capabilities your agent will need.",
  "objectives": [
    "Identify a specific problem your agent will solve",
    "Define 3-5 capabilities your agent needs",
    "List the tools and data sources required",
    "Articulate why AgentCore is the right platform for this agent"
  ],
  "context": "Throughout this course, you'll be working toward a capstone project where you build and deploy a real agent. Starting with a clear vision makes all the difference. The best agent ideas are specific (not 'help with everything'), achievable (can be built with AgentCore's capabilities), and useful (solves a real problem you or others have).",
  "instructions": "Complete the Agent Idea Canvas below. Think carefully about each section - your answers here will guide your learning throughout the course.\n\n**Tips for a good agent idea:**\n- Be specific: 'Answer customer questions about our return policy' is better than 'help customers'\n- Be realistic: Start with something you can build in a few hours, not a world-changing AI\n- Be passionate: Pick something you actually want to use or that solves a real problem you've seen",

  "tutorPrompt": "The student has completed the Agent Idea Canvas exercise. Review their submission and provide constructive feedback. Check if their problem statement is specific enough, if their capabilities are realistic for AgentCore, and if their success metric is measurable. Suggest improvements where needed, but be encouraging - this is their first step toward building something real."
