  "content": "# Choose Your Capstone Project\n\nCongratulations! You've learned the fundamentals of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. Now it's time to put that knowledge into action by building a real, deployable agent.\n\nThis capstone project is your opportunity to create something you can actually use and show off. By the end, you'll have a working agent deployed to AgentCore.\n\n## Project Options\n\nChoose ONE of the following project types. Each builds on what you've learned, but emphasizes different aspects of AgentCore.\n\n### Option 1: Customer Support Agent\n\n**What it does:** Answers customer questions using a knowledge base of FAQs, documentation, or product information.\n\n**Key features:**\n- Retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base\n- Provides accurate, helpful responses\n- Escalates complex issues appropriately\n- Maintains conversation context\n\n**Best for:** If you want to focus on **Memory Service** and **knowledge retrieval patterns**.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n- Product FAQ bot for an e-commerce site\n- Internal IT helpdesk assistant\n- Documentation navigator for a software product\n\n```\nUser: \"How do I reset my password?\"\nAgent: \"To reset your password, go to Settings > Security > Reset Password. \n        You'll receive a verification email within 2 minutes. \n        Would you like me to walk you through the steps?\"\n```\n\n### Option 2: Research Assistant\n\n**What it does:** Searches for information, summarizes findings, and helps users understand complex topics.\n\n**Key features:**\n- Searches multiple data sources\n- Synthesizes information into clear summaries\n- Cites sources appropriately\n- Handles follow-up questions\n\n**Best for:** If you want to focus on **Tool Service** and **multi-step reasoning**.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n- Market research assistant\n- Academic paper summarizer\n- Competitive analysis helper\n\n```\nUser: \"What are the latest trends in AI agents?\"\nAgent: \"Based on recent sources, here are the top 3 trends:\n        1. Multi-agent orchestration (Source: AWS Blog, Jan 2025)\n        2. Tool-augmented reasoning (Source: Anthropic Research)\n        3. Memory-enhanced conversations (Source: Industry Report)\n        Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these?\"\n```\n\n### Option 3: Data Analyst Agent\n\n**What it does:** Queries databases, analyzes data, and generates insights or reports.\n\n**Key features:**\n- Connects to data sources (databases, APIs)\n- Translates natural language to queries\n- Visualizes or summarizes results\n- Explains findings in plain language\n\n**Best for:** If you want to focus on **custom tools** and **structured data handling**.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n- Sales dashboard assistant\n- Log analysis helper\n- Business metrics reporter\n\n```\nUser: \"What were our top-selling products last month?\"\nAgent: \"I queried the sales database. Here are your top 5 products:\n        1. Widget Pro - $45,230 (↑12% from previous month)\n        2. Gadget Plus - $38,100 (↑8%)\n        3. Tool Kit - $29,500 (↓3%)\n        Should I create a detailed report or analyze a specific product?\"\n```\n\n### Option 4: Personal Productivity Agent\n\n**What it does:** Helps manage tasks, schedule, notes, and personal workflows.\n\n**Key features:**\n- Creates and manages tasks\n- Sets reminders and schedules\n- Takes and organizes notes\n- Integrates with calendar/task tools\n\n**Best for:** If you want to focus on **stateful interactions** and **action-oriented tools**.\n\n**Example use cases:**\n- Personal task manager\n- Meeting prep assistant\n- Note-taking and organization helper\n\n```\nUser: \"Add a task to review the Q4 report by Friday\"\nAgent: \"I've created the task 'Review Q4 Report' with a due date of Friday.\n        Priority: Medium (default)\n        I also noticed you have 2 other tasks due this week. \n        Would you like me to show your full task list?\"\n```\n\n## How to Choose\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n1. **What excites you?** Pick the project that you'd actually want to use.\n\n2. **What do you want to master?** Each project emphasizes different AgentCore features:\n   - Customer Support → Memory patterns\n   - Research Assistant → Tool orchestration\n   - Data Analyst → Custom tools\n   - Productivity → Stateful actions\n\n3. **What's realistic?** Consider your available time and data sources. The Customer Support agent is often the quickest to build; the Data Analyst requires actual data to query.\n\n## Define Your Requirements\n\nOnce you've chosen, define your specific implementation:\n\n### 1. Problem Statement\nWhat specific problem will your agent solve? Be concrete.\n\n**Weak:** \"Help users with questions\"\n**Strong:** \"Answer common questions about our return policy, shipping times, and order status using our FAQ database\"\n\n### 2. Core Capabilities (3-5)\nWhat must your agent be able to do? List the essential features.\n\nExample for Customer Support:\n- Search FAQ database for relevant answers\n- Remember context from earlier in the conversation\n- Provide step-by-step instructions when needed\n- Know when to escalate to a human\n\n### 3. Required Tools\nWhat tools will your agent need? Be specific.\n\nExample:\n- `search_faq` - Searches the FAQ knowledge base\n- `get_order_status` - Retrieves order information\n- `escalate_to_human` - Transfers to human support\n\n### 4. Success Criteria\nHow will you know your agent works? Define measurable goals.\n\nExample:\n- Correctly answers 80%+ of FAQ questions\n- Maintains context across 5+ turns\n- Escalates appropriately (not too often, not too rarely)\n\n## Your Assignment\n\nBefore moving to the next lesson:\n\n1. **Choose your project type** from the four options\n2. **Write a 2-3 sentence problem statement**\n3. **List 3-5 core capabilities**\n4. **Identify 2-4 tools you'll need**\n5. **Define 2-3 success criteria**\n\nUse the AI tutor to discuss your ideas. It can help you refine your requirements and identify gaps.\n\n## What's Next\n\nIn the next lesson, you'll design your agent's architecture - how the pieces fit together, which AgentCore services you'll use, and how data flows through your system.\n\nYour requirements document becomes the foundation for that design."
